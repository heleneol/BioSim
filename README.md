# BioSim: A Population Dynamics Simulation of Rossumøya
*BioSim* pagkage simulates the population dynamics of Rossumøya. 
A strongly simplified ecosystem containing herbivores and carnivores can be initialized by the user through the 
creation of a BioSim object. The animals then feed, procreate, migrate, age and die automaticle for a user-given
amount of years.
